ðŸš¢ Project Overview: Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic Dataset ðŸ“Š

As part of my role at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS, I recently completed an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on the Titanic dataset. This project involved a thorough examination of the data to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights that could inform further analysis and predictive modeling. Hereâ€™s an overview of what I accomplished:

Objective:

The primary goal was to perform an in-depth EDA on the Titanic dataset to understand its characteristics, distributions, correlations, and outliers.

Steps Taken:

1.Data Loading and Cleaning:

â€¢Imported the dataset using pandas.
â€¢Filled missing values in the Age and Embarked columns.
â€¢Dropped the Cabin column due to a significant amount of missing data.

2.Descriptive Statistics and Basic Information:

â€¢Displayed the first few rows to get an initial sense of the data.
â€¢Used info() to understand the data types and non-null counts.
â€¢Generated summary statistics to understand the central tendencies and dispersions.

3.Visualizations:

â€¢Age Distribution: Created a histogram with KDE to visualize the age demographics.
â€¢Survival Count: Used a count plot to show the number of survivors vs. non-survivors.
â€¢Passenger Class Distribution: Analyzed the distribution of passengers across different classes.
â€¢Embarked Locations: Visualized the count of passengers embarking from different locations.
â€¢Age vs. Fare Scatter Plot: Examined the relationship between age and fare, with survival status as a hue.
â€¢Correlation Matrix: Generated a heatmap to identify correlations between numerical features.

Key Insights:

â€¢Age: The median age was 28, with a broad age range from infants to 80-year-olds.
â€¢Survival Rate: Approximately 38% of the passengers survived.
â€¢Class Distribution: Most passengers were in the third class.
â€¢Embarked Locations: The majority of passengers boarded from Southampton.
â€¢Fare vs. Age: Higher fares were generally associated with higher survival rates.
â€¢Correlations: A positive correlation was observed between Fare and Survived, indicating that higher-paying passengers had better chances of survival.

Conclusion:

This project provided valuable insights into the Titanic dataset and highlighted the importance of EDA in understanding and preparing data for further analysis. The visualizations and statistical summaries helped identify key patterns and relationships that are crucial for building predictive models.
